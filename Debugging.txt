Notes for debugging

Setup:
Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
Eclipse running Sloebr V3 plugin

Arduino Board Selection under Project -> Properties -> Arduino
Boards.txt file: /opt/eclipse/arduinoPlugin/packages/Intel/hardware/arc32/2.0.2/board.txt
Board: Arduino/Genuino 101
Upload Protocol: Default
Port: /dev/ttyACM0


/dev/ttyACM0 port connection issue
When attempting to open the serial monitor view and connecting to the port, this appears:  
"Serial port /dev/ttyACM0 not found. Did you select the right one from the project properties -> Arduino -> Arduino?
Port name - /dev/ttyACM0; Method name - openPort(); Exception type - Port not found."

Adding the line in the eclipse.ini file as suggested by this thread did not resolve the issue: https://github.com/Sloeber/arduino-eclipse-plugin/issues/7
/opt/eclipse/arduinoPlugin/tools/Intel/arduino101load/1.6.9+1.28/scripts/create_dfu_udev_rule

Added user to dialout group and logged in/out again. Seemed to fix problem.

Steps:
1. Turn on computer.
2. Plug in Arduino.
3. Check that ttyACM0 is created in /dev directory
4. Open Eclipse, compile project and build
5. Wait a few seconds. Then click "Open Serial Monitor" from the TOP MENU (little magnifying glass).
6. Prior to uploading next sketch, remove the existing serial port from the monitor.
